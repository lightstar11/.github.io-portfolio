    <p class="about-mandalorian's"> Mandalorian's originate from there home world of Mandalore. Mandalorian they are easily one of the most important groups in the star wars galaxy. But people don't really seem to know much about them. Aside from the fact that they have some really cool looking armor. The Mandalorians originolly held from the plant Mandalore in the outer rim. Although they were pre-dominant human well at least the good parts. The mandalorian were actully an ethnol-linguistic group. Defined by their shared language Mando'a and warrior culture so they would accept any individual that wanted to join them as long as they followed the mandalorian way of life. In Legends the mandalorian's were also a culture that was defined by their warrior traditions and langugee and not racial make up. Although the origins of mandolorian can be traced back to thir lineage on coruscant. Well that untill Mandalore the First led his people to there original home plant. He was reportedly responsible for starting the Mandalorian crusades. After he killed a gigantce Mythosaur. Which solidified his leadership and badassness.</p>
